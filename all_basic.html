    <div id="roshan"> What is life?</div>
    <div id="essay">Throughout the world almost every living person on the planet will witness suffering at least once in a life time. Suffering as we know it is defined as the pain we experience due to an injury, medical malpractice or even disruptions in one’s family
        life and etc. Although we endure suffering, do we constantly suffer? According to the German Philosopher, Arthur Schopenhauer who proposed that life is “full of suffering” and that this suffering is directly caused by the will of the individual.
        I wish in this short paper to carry this claim further and try to explain why Schopenhauer thinks that life is full of suffering and how he believes that this suffering can be overcome. I will also attempt to show my perspective of why I don’t
        agree to his arguments.<br> Schopenhauer proposed his pessimistic view on an individual’s condition in this world by stating that life is filled with suffering, and that this suffering that we experience is directly caused by our will. We know
        Life tends to want, and because its wants are regularly unfulfilled, it largely exists unfulfilled and in a state of deprivation. By the wanting or expecting something, an individual is setting himself up to sufferÂ until that objective is met.
        Then, upon fulfillment of the desire, a new aim is set forth, and thus the cycle of suffering begins again. When Schopenhauer says that all life is suffering he means everything that lives and strives, is filled with suffering, he puts it as “It
        is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world.”(Pg 63) Suffering is ultimately caused by the frustration and conflict that arises from competition between individual wills. For Schopenhauer suffering seems
        to be such a great cause that the world is subjected to, he feels happiness that we experience at times is not actually happiness in life.
